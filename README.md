The jQuery project for Grand Circus began at the beginning of week 3. 

Project Build rules were to create the UI based on a wireframe provided. You must be able to hide/show a form when selecting an available table to reserve and must not be able to select or modify already reserved table. When hovering over reserved tables, details of reservation must appear. 

Project was completed within a day of assignment.
